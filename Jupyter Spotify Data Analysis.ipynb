    "### Max Perez evaluation\n",
    "Gustav fulfilled all of his functional and non functional requirements. Regarding his functional requirements, Gus was able to load and clean the data properly, loading the data into his .csv file and removing all unnecessary data. His analysis and code regarding it  worked well as all functions completely ran. His visualisation was also quite good because they all worked well. Regarding his data reporting, the file was successfully loaded and stored. His non functional requirements were also fulfilled as the READ ME included information of how to use the UI, however, he could be more specific with the reliability functions. In conclusion, Gustav had a well made UI, however, in future should work on his time management and specify his functions more.\n",
    "### Jackson Wang evaluation\n",
    "Gustav fufilled all of the critera that he set for himself in the functional and non function requirements. Regarding his functional requirements, Gustav was able to effectively clean, load and transport the data without any corruption or loss. This project reflects the effort that he put into this project and he has applied himself very well through this task. However, he could have benefitted from a better GUI and from more complexion throughout his code. In conclusion, Gustav had an excellent final product, however he could benefit in the future by spending more time making the final product more sophisticated.\n",
    "### Personal Evaluation\n",
    "This data has revealed interesting information about itself, which did struggle for accuracy at times with missing values, but where the values were present, certain trends were able to be spotted. One such example of this is with function 2 of comparing danceability with the instrumentalness of the songs and the energy percentage of the songs. There didn't seem like there was any correlation between energy and danceability but when it came to danceability and the instrumentalness there was some form of trend of the instrumentalness declining as the danceabiity percentage decreased. This is likely due to more songs that feature long instrumentals being better for dancing as it is not taken up by complicated vocals as much allowing for more focus to be on dancers. I also discovered that there appeared to be no correlation between energy percentage and bpm of the songs which surprised me, as I expected many of the slower songs to have less energy but that wasn't very visible, which in hindsight might have been more efficient to display as a line graph. The visualisation of the UI was still decently good but taking into consideration some of the feeedback on the UI, I should have managed my time better so I could allocate more time to making my UI graphical. With my functional requirements I feel I met them well as everything that the program required functioned correctly except I did not succeed in figuring out saving the new dataset to a new .csv as it just made more sense to save it as a variable in the code. When it came to reliability I could have elaborated more as per peer feedback but when it came to the program itself it never breaks when in use now and the UI itself is very clearly laid out so users should not have trouble using it. Overall this project could have benefitted from time management allowing for the aesthetics of the UI to be better, as well as elaborating more throughout the whole of the theory."
